# ANALYZE-FARMBURG-S-A-B-TEST
## Getting Familiar with FarmBurg
Brian is a Product Manager at FarmBurg, a company that makes a farming simulation social network game. In the FarmBurg game, you can plow, plant, and harvest different crops.

In this project, We will analysis for an A/B Test for Farmburg .

Brian tells you that he ran an A/B test with three different groups: A, B, and C. You’re kind of busy today, so you don’t ask too many questions about the differences between A, B, and C. Maybe they were shown three different versions of an ad. Who cares?


Brian gives you a CSV of results called clicks.csv. It has the following columns:

user_id: a unique id for each visitor to the FarmBurg site
ab_test_group: either A, B, or C depending on which group the visitor was assigned to
click_day: only filled in if the user clicked on a link to purchase
